# py_websockets_timeecho_test
A test/showcase for myself to understand asyncio and websockets usage a little better. Open for commenting/help from anyone! Probably the most ineffficient clock of the world.

Want to try: Just download and run with python3. Or download Thonny IDE and run there.

Program opens a websockets-connection to socket echo on websocket.org and then sends the current time and in paralell receives the echo and prints to the console.
